        <h2> Math Timed Test </h2>
        <img style="width: 80%;" src="images/timedtest.png" alt="Timed Test Screenshot"/>
        <p> <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/math-timed-test/id925511195?mt=8" target="_blank">Math Timed Test</a> is an iPad app designed to help the younger students
          at my school to learn and be assessed on their addition, subtraction, and multiplication math facts.  The app
          was my first assignment on an independent project for Porter-Gaud's Computer Science I course.
          Written completely in <b>Swift</b>, the app is available for free on the iOS App Store.

        <h2> PG Schedule </h2>
        <img style="width: 90%;" src="images/schedule.png" alt="Screenshot of the PG Schedule First Iteration"/>
        <p> I have contributed to two iterations of the Porter-Gaud Student Schedule app.  The first was taken from
        a graduated senior's Computer Science IV project, and my task was to take it from "working condition" to an app
        which the entire school could use.  The second iteration stood alongside the original, mainly being created to
        provide an API so future iOS and Watch apps can take advantage of it.  The former is written in <b>Javascript</b>, while the latter
        was written in <b>Node.js</b> taking advantage of the <b>MEAN</b> stack (<b>Mongo, Express, Angular, and Node</b>).
        The second one is <b>open source</b> (available <a href="https://github.com/ireallydontcare/pg-schedule" target="_blank">here</a>)
        so other students can contribute and tweak the API to their liking.

        <h2> WWDC Scholarship </h2>
        <img style="width: 80%;" src="images/wwdc15.png" alt="WWDC 2015 Screenshot"/>
        <p> I have won two WWDC Scholarships, in 2014 and 2015. The Scholarship program itself allowed for a number (200 in 2014, 350 in 2015)
        students to attend WWDC with a free conference ticket.  Throughout both years, I have been an active member in our Slack and Facebook
        groups designed for us to communicate with each other.  While the 2014 app was written in <b>Objective-C</b>,
        the 2015 version was written entirely in <b>Swift</b>, Apple's new programming language. The 2015 app is open source,
        available <a href="https://github.com/tillson/wwdc-2015" target="_blank">here</a> on Github.

        <h2> PG Progress Reports </h2>
        <img style="width: 100%;" src="images/progress.png" alt="Progress Report Webpage"/>
        <p>For my second project in 9th grade Computer Science I, I created a website written in <b>PHP</b> to help teachers send
        progress reports to student's and their parents.  Instead of manually gathering data about a student (parents, homeroom teacher, etc.),
        all that they are required to input in this app is the student's name and their own name.  From there, the app automatically
        finds the names and emails of the student's parents, homeroom teacher, the principal, and the dean.  The app seamlessly works
        between Middle and High school students, filling the appropriate dean/principal information for each one.  The main page
        also features a typeahead (written with <b>jQuery</b> and <b>Javascript</b>) to filter the names of students and teachers.

        <h2> WWDC Alerts </h2>
        <img style="width: 100%;" src="images/wwdcupdate.png" alt="Progress Report Webpage"/>
        <p>Before WWDC 2015 was announced by Apple, I wrote an app in <b>Node</b> (also using the <b>MEAN</b> stack)
          to notify anyone who signed up for the service as soon as the WWDC info page was updated.  The app worked
          perfectly, and at 8:45 EST on April 14, dozens of people recieved an Twilio SMS message.  The app was written after
          school one day, partially thanks to Mountain Dew and some pizza.<br><br>

          I wrote a second <b>Node</b> app after submissions were due to send a <a href="http://justyo.co/" target="_blank">Yo</a> notification to
          users as soon as their WWDC scholarship status email arrived.  The app checked the Gmail API to see if the
          email had arrived, and would activate if it did. The core functionality was hacked together in just a night,
          and <a href="http://www2.meethue.com/" target="_blank">Philips Hue</a> integration was added the next day.  The Hue integration blinked the
          home's lights green or red based if the user was accepted or not.  The entire app is <a href="/web/20161024152305/https://github.com/tillson/dubdubyo" target="_blank">open source on Github</a>.
